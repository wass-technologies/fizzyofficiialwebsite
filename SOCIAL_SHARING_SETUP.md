# Social Sharing Image Setup

## Instructions:
1. Save your WASS social sharing image (the one with the team and "Clarity. Intention. Delivery." text) as `og-image.jpg`
2. Replace the placeholder file at: `public/og-image.jpg`
3. Recommended image dimensions: 1200x630 pixels (optimal for social media sharing)

## What's been updated:
- Footer now includes copyright with WASS branding and link to webappssoft.com
- Favicon changed to WASS logo
- Social sharing metadata configured in layout.tsx
- When the site URL is shared on social media, your WASS image will appear

## Optional: Set your site URL
Add this to your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```
